        <p>
          Me and my team had the exciting opportunity to participate in the First LEGO League (FLL), 
          where we designed and built a LEGO-based robot 
          capable of completing various missions. 
          Alongside the robot challenge, we also developed a project focused on underwater 
          life and explored innovative ways to sustain marine ecosystems.

        <p>
          Me and my partner (Moez) and I participated in the Physics Exhibition, where we showcased a 
          project called Clean Vision. Our project demonstrated a creative and practical way to improve the environment around us by promoting cleaner air and sustainable living. Through this experience, we not only aimed to make a 
          positive impact on the environment but also grew our scientific, technical, and teamwork skills.

        <p>
          My team and I participated in the Organic Expo, where we created a project that explored 
          the fundamentals of sustainability. We also built a working model that demonstrated
          practical ways to improve the environment through eco-friendly practices. 
          This experience not only deepened my understanding of environmental issues but also helped 
          me strengthen my scientific, technical, and soft skills.

          My partner Moez and I participated in Globex, where we built a working homemade water filter. 
          Our project earned us 2nd place out of 200 students, showcasing our teamwork, technical skills,
          and dedication. The experience not only highlighted our hard work but also 
          taught us valuable new concepts related to sustainability, problem-solving, and innovation.
