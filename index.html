      <p class="tagline expanded-text">
        Fueled by curiosity, I dive into tough problems without hesitation. Learning feels alive when ideas shift into hands-on work. What matters most? Growth through doing, questioning, building. Projects ground theory in reality, which keeps me engaged. Pushing limits isn’t the goal - it just happens along the way
        Fueled by curiosity, I move between coding and flight dreams with equal interest. Learning stretches me - through circuits, robot builds, or quiet focus over a chessboard. Engineering pulls me in, just like the sky does. Growth shows up in small steps, not grand plans. Each challenge adds something new
        Fueled by questions, shaped through routine, growth shows up in coding strength paired with guiding others steadily.
        Football keeps me moving when classes slow down. Puzzles come next, fitting pieces together after school ends. Building new things sparks curiosity midweek. Each activity shapes how I see problems differently by Friday
        Flying through challenges keeps my mind sharp. Creativity shapes how I solve problems in code and design. Growth happens when effort meets curiosity. Tackling computer science feels like piecing together puzzles that matter. Machines take flight because engineering turns ideas into motion. Skies open up once knowledge lifts me beyond limits.

          <h3>🎯 Profile</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Starting fresh each day drives me forward - Mahmoud Ahmed Mobarak by name, a learner shaped by curiosity. Schoolwork pulls me in, yet so do lines of code, mechanical puzzles, and making things others haven’t imagined. 
          Growth isn’t planned; it happens when difficulty shows up, then I lean in. New problems act like magnets, drawing time and thought without warning."></p>

        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>📚 Strengths</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Built on analysis and routine, success comes through tackling challenges methodically. Shifting into unfamiliar settings feels natural, almost automatic. 
          Collaboration matters, so sharing ideas openly becomes habit. Clear dialogue supports steady progress, step by step. Each assignment gets full attention, nothing less expected."></p>

        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>🧠 Passions</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Curiosity thrives when building real systems - whether it's software puzzles, flying machines, circuits that move, logic games, or mechanical designs. What fuels effort isn’t just theory, 
          but touching, testing, adjusting. Each challenge pulls focus like a riddle waiting to unfold. Progress often hides where tools meet trial. Learning sticks best when fingers get involved."></p>

          <h3>🚀 Goals</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Aiming high drives me toward becoming a recognized scholar, gaining entry into a prominent university. One path opens to computer science, another veers into aerospace engineering, or perhaps flight decks as a pilot. Technical ability blends with inventive thinking, 
          guided by initiative. Influence grows quietly through focused effort, steady choices, consistent work."></p>

          <h3>🌟 Philosophy</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Starting something new means stepping away from what feels safe. Growth comes not all at once, but slowly - through consistent effort combined with genuine interest in understanding. Progress happens when small actions add up, 
          especially during moments that feel hard. Each obstacle met becomes less like a wall and more like a window showing what you are truly capable of."></p>
