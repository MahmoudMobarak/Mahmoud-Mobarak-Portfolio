      <h1>Hello, I’m <span>Mahmoud Ahmed Mobarak</span></h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">A Year 10 Student at The Westminster School, Dubai</h2>

      <p class="tagline expanded-text">
        I am a high-achieving student passionate about learning, innovation, and excellence. I enjoy tackling complex challenges, exploring new ideas, and applying knowledge practically in projects and real-life applications.  
        I constantly strive to grow academically, personally, and creatively, whether through coding, engineering, robotics, chess, or pursuing aerospace and aviation interests.  
        I am driven by curiosity, discipline, and a commitment to develop both my technical skills and leadership capabilities.  
        Beyond academics, I enjoy engaging in extracurricular activities like football, solving puzzles, and creating innovative projects that expand my skillset and understanding of the world.  
        My ultimate goal is to combine creativity, technical mastery, and personal growth to excel in multiple fields including Computer Science, Aerospace Engineering, and Aviation.

          <h3>🎯 Profile</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Starting fresh each day drives me forward - Mahmoud Ahmed Mobarak by name, a learner shaped by curiosity. Schoolwork pulls me in, yet so do lines of code, mechanical puzzles, and making things others haven’t imagined. 
          Growth isn’t planned; it happens when difficulty shows up, then I lean in. New problems act like magnets, drawing time and thought without warning."></p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>📚 Strengths</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Built on analysis and routine, success comes through tackling challenges methodically. Shifting into unfamiliar settings feels natural, almost automatic. 
          Collaboration matters, so sharing ideas openly becomes habit. Clear dialogue supports steady progress, step by step. Each assignment gets full attention, nothing less expected."></p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>🧠 Passions</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Curiosity thrives when building real systems - whether it's software puzzles, flying machines, circuits that move, logic games, or mechanical designs. What fuels effort isn’t just theory, 
          but touching, testing, adjusting. Each challenge pulls focus like a riddle waiting to unfold. Progress often hides where tools meet trial. Learning sticks best when fingers get involved."></p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>🚀 Goals</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Aiming high drives me toward becoming a recognized scholar, gaining entry into a prominent university. One path opens to computer science, another veers into aerospace engineering, or perhaps flight decks as a pilot. Technical ability blends with inventive thinking, 
          guided by initiative. Influence grows quietly through focused effort, steady choices, consistent work."></p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-card">
          <h3>🌟 Philosophy</h3>
          <p class="typing-text" data-text="Starting something new means stepping away from what feels safe. Growth comes not all at once, but slowly - through consistent effort combined with genuine interest in understanding. Progress happens when small actions add up, 
          especially during moments that feel hard. Each obstacle met becomes less like a wall and more like a window showing what you are truly capable of."></p>
